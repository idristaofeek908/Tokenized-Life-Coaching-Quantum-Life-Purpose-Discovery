# Tokenized Life Coaching: Quantum Life Purpose Discovery

A blockchain-based life coaching platform that leverages quantum principles to help individuals discover, align with, and fulfill their life purpose through tokenized interactions and smart contract automation.

## üåü Overview

This system provides a comprehensive framework for quantum life purpose discovery through five interconnected smart contracts that manage the entire coaching journey from verification to optimization.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contracts

1. **Coach Verification Contract** (`coach-verification.clar`)
    - Manages coach registration and verification
    - Tracks coach credentials, experience, and ratings
    - Ensures only qualified coaches participate in the platform

2. **Discovery Protocol Contract** (`discovery-protocol.clar`)
    - Handles quantum life purpose discovery sessions
    - Manages session scheduling, execution, and completion
    - Tracks quantum insights and purpose clarity scores

3. **Purpose Alignment Contract** (`purpose-alignment.clar`)
    - Aligns discovered life purpose with daily actions
    - Monitors alignment scores and quantum coherence
    - Identifies misalignment areas for improvement

4. **Fulfillment Tracking Contract** (`fulfillment-tracking.clar`)
    - Tracks progress toward life purpose fulfillment
    - Manages milestones and achievement metrics
    - Calculates overall fulfillment scores

5. **Mission Optimization Contract** (`mission-optimization.clar`)
    - Optimizes life purpose missions based on data
    - Provides AI-driven recommendations
    - Tracks optimization history and impact

## üöÄ Key Features

\`\`\`

### Usage Examples

#### For Coaches

1. **Register as a Coach**
   \`\`\`clarity
   (contract-call? .coach-verification register-coach
   "Quantum Life Purpose Specialist"
   u5
   u3)
   \`\`\`

2. **Create Discovery Session**
   \`\`\`clarity
   (contract-call? .discovery-protocol create-discovery-session
   'SP1234...COACH-ADDRESS
   "Deep Quantum Purpose Discovery"
   u1000000)
   \`\`\`

#### For Clients

1. **Set Core Purpose**
   \`\`\`clarity
   (contract-call? .purpose-alignment set-core-purpose
   "To inspire and empower others through authentic creative expression")
   \`\`\`

2. **Create Fulfillment Milestone**
   \`\`\`clarity
   (contract-call? .fulfillment-tracking create-milestone
   "Launch Creative Workshop Series"
   "Develop and launch monthly workshops for aspiring artists"
   u1000
   u85)
   \`\`\`
